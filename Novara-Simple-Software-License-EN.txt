Novara Simple Software License (NSSL)

Development Notice (Living License)
This license is a living document under continuous development. There are no fixed version numbers. 
Updates and improvements are integrated over time as long as the author (Thomas / DiamantTh) maintains it.
Newer texts replace older ones, but rights already granted remain valid. Interpretations should favor user freedom and transparency.

Preamble
This license was created to provide a simplified and clear version of the Novara Software Freedom License (NSFL). 
It protects the fundamental freedoms to use, study, share, and modify software, while adding a lightweight transparency obligation for network and commercial use.
It is intended for small and medium-sized projects, experiments, and prototypes where full legal length would be excessive.

1. Freedom
You may use, study, modify, and share this software for any purpose, provided that this license text is included and clearly visible to all recipients.

2. Source and Transparency
If you distribute or make the program available to others (including network services), you must provide the corresponding source code, build scripts, and configuration needed to reproduce your version.
Any changes used in public or production environments must be published within 45 days of deployment.

3. Network and Service Use
Operating the program as a service counts as public distribution. 
You must ensure users can access the source code and documentation of the version you operate, excluding passwords or private keys.
Artificial restrictions such as “cloud-only” modules are not allowed.

4. Fair Commercial Use
You may charge for hosting, support, or integration, but you may not charge more than production cost plus 25% margin.
Access to source code or functionality must not depend on payment beyond this fair price.

5. Anti-DRM and Ethics
You may not include DRM, spyware, or surveillance systems in any version of the program.
Use for weapon systems or purposes primarily intended to harm people is prohibited.

6. Patents and Compatibility
Each contributor grants a royalty-free, worldwide patent license for their contributions.
This license is compatible with software released under the NSFL or AGPLv3.

7. Termination and Reinstatement
Any violation of sections 2–5 terminates your rights under this license automatically.
If you correct the violation within 30 days and make the fix public, your rights are reinstated.

8. Warranty and Liability
This software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. 
The author is not liable for any damages arising from its use.

9. Interpretation
Ambiguities must be resolved to preserve the freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software.
If any part is found unenforceable, the remainder remains in full force.
